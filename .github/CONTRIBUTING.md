# How to Contribute

If you want to implement new methods, follow this general format.

- Method names must match the LeetCode problem name in snake case, e.g. Two Sum -> two_sum
- Method definitions must match the LeetCode definitions provided, types and all (excluding externally defined types like ListNode)
- Test names must be named the same, prefixed with `test_`
- Test cases must match the test cases given by LeetCode

Below are features/documentation that may be implemented in future release, but are not deemed a priority as of now.

- Method documentation
- Assertions to validate method inputs
- Extensive test cases/full code coverage
